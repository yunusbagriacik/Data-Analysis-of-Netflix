# Data-Analysis-of-Netflix
 It is one of the DataCamp projects that I completed a couple of months ago. In this project, I examined the change of film durations depending on time. Results are surprising! Dataset was ready to implement so there is no need to clean. For now we're quite lucky that most of the real world datasets are not tidy.
